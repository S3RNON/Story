### The Devil of all Earth
Standing on top of a million burnt corpses, ready to burn more.  
The echoes of a thousand footsteps thunder around the world.  
One finger pointed at his head, the Devil of all Earth proclaims  
"*I feel awful*". 

### I just am... Alive
You know, I've always preferred the nights over the daytime. Not because I'm an introvert or anything but because of the power that I feel walking down the city at three in the morning. But let me tell you this crazy story, this one time these two men walked up to me. Asked me, "you the one for the lift?". And of course I wasn't. I had never seen these men in my life. So I told them:  
"Yeah duh. Do I *look* like I'm not?".   
"No jokes. Get in" said one of them as the other one opened some car door. I stepped in, made myself a bit comfortable and then it hit me. "What in God's name am I doing?"  That must've been the sun coming back up, making me lose my self confidence  
Not yet. I wasn't done.  
"I didn't know you were this scrawny" said one of them. They were both now in the car. One driving and the other one in the passenger seat.  
"Well, you know, most people don't get to see me anyway."  
"I suppose."  
"So what brought you guys in this business?"  
"Money. What do you *think* smartass?"  
I was feeling their doubts towards me. This had to be the riskiest thing I had ever done.  
"You then? Have you got some special reason?" one of them asked.  
Silence.  
"I uh..."  
I mustn't lose my confidence. They'll find me out.  
"I just am.. *Alive*."  
"What does that mean?"  
I didn't really know. It just felt the right thing to say.  
"Have any of you fellas seen my mask? I must have lost mine..."  
"Mask?"
